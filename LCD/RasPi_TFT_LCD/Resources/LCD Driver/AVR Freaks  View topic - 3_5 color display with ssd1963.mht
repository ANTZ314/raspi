<BR>Looks pretty neat.... has room for several pages of 320x240 rgb. I =
have=20
fought with several lcd/controller inits.... you need to tell it the =
height and=20
width of the lcd, bytes per pix. Then to tell if you have the right =
init, you=20
need a fillscreen and a clearscreen... just 2 nested loops for x and =
y.... the x=20
and y could be upside down and backward, but you cant tell till you get =
it=20
working. If you had 2 of them and sent me one, I'd try to get my simple =
graphics=20
stuff to run on it. (lines, rects, text etc)

Ok now I had time to get it up running, and thanks to Bob I did not have =
any=20
problems to get something on the display, but I was missing some lines =
so for=20
the info on a winstar 320x240 with a ssd1963 driver vsync has to be =
0x0197 and=20
not 0x0148. <BR><BR>I can't wait to play with this privat, to have 1 MB =

on a AVR is a dream. And more than than 800KB as a sample buffer, nice =
storage=20
OSC.

crystal fonts has 320x240 lcds for a good price. The example code from =
CF is=20
done in AVR studio. <BR><BR>I have the 2.4" 320x240, <!-- m --><A=20

. The demo code from CF was for the atmega1281, I managed to get 8 bit =

working with an atmega88. Was not able to get 16 bit parallel working, =
probably=20
just a wiring problem. <BR><BR>Once I realized how much data was =
required to=20
drive a 320x240 color display, I have to really think hard about using =
it in a=20
product with an AVR 8bit uC. That stuff really does need a 32 bitter to =
do=20
decent graphics. Not only alot of MIPS, but also alot of code, you can =
use=20
commercial graphics libraries but you end up paying alot of money. High =
rez=20
color LCD is a world of hurt.

I have the basic things up running now, do init , text <BR>plot points, =
boxes=20
etc. and that take about 2K of code in GCC code (ASM code would be about =
the=20
half). So I don't see it as a problem with a AVR.(I use a mega16 @ 16 =
MHz). I=20
really only need to make dma routine to and from a dataflash and the =
display=20
RAM. I allreaddy have made the rs232 routine that can show a photo send =
as a=20
textfile from a PC.(I have made a small Delphi program that make the =
textfile).=20
<BR>The code for the touch screen will only be about 100 bytes of code.

Can you write a one or two paragraph outline of how to read the =
touchscreen?

 <B>sparrow2</B> - Jun 16, 2010 - 05:02 PM<BR><B>Post subject: </B>
<HR class=3Dsep>
Yes <BR>You use 4 IO's 2 has to be ADC(but best with all 4). <BR>output =
low and=20
high on the X pins and read one of the Y pins with a ADC (It's best to =
read on=20
both). <BR>Then flip direction on the X and Y pins. and get the X value. =

<BR><BR>Edit <BR>I should add that you need some filtering. And a check =
that the=20
value have been "about" stable for some readings before you deside that =
it's a=20
good value (no touch give a lot of noisey readings).

 Good Day, <BR><BR>I have a 3.5" 320*240 from winstar it has a 16 bit =
interface.=20
I can successfully display an image using it in 8bit mode, but i cannot =
get it=20
working in either of the 2 16 bit modes as described in the SSD1963 =
Datasheet. I=20
have tried everything i can think of from reading the initialization =
code from=20
Winstar as well as the datasheet. <BR><BR>Any help will be appreciated=20

 Hi All, <BR><BR>I have found out how to send the data for 16 bit mode, =
but the=20
display seems to only display 16 colors and not 262k colors, does anyone =
have=20
experience with this display? sparrow2 or bobgardner? <BR><BR>Any help =
will be=20
appreciated.

<HR class=3Dsep>
 That number of colors needs 6 bits in R, G and B... that's 18 bits per =
pixel.=20
How do you load and store an 18 bit pixel over a 16 bit port? If its =
possible,=20
its got to be in the datasheet somewhere.

 I have only used the 3 times 8 bit (where only 6 bit is used) in 8 bit =

that works fine.
