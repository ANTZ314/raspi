NOTES:

rasFaceRec0:
-> Possibly the original?
-> used the 'k' key to capture image
-> 'q' key to quit image window
-> no blinking led to indicate success/failure

rasFaceRec1:
-> select to capture new face or use existing
-> if new, bounding box is drawn around detecte3d face
-> use either 'k' key or push button to capure ('q' to exit)
-> 'a' to attempt recognition in capture image
-> if recognised, blink green twice, else blink red twice


rasFaceRec2:
-> same as above but:
	-> Uses push button for face capture
	-> will blink green LED when valid face is detected

Changes to make:
-> Completely headless?
	-> not display image window or draw facial bounding box
	-> remove action prompts:
		=> "capture new image" 	(start on button hold)
		=> "recognise face" 	(attempt after capture)
-> maybe confirmation button press after capture?
