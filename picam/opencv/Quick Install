Quick Install OpenCV - PiZero?:
===============================

sudo pip install --upgrade pip

sudo apt install python-opencv


---------------------------------------------------
Step1 - In code box below Select All then right click copy on highlighted command.
Step2 - On a logged in RPI SSH terminal session right click paste then Enter to Run setup.sh script

Code:

$ curl -L https://raw.github.com/pageauc/opencv3-setup/master/setup.sh | bash 

curl comand will run the GitHub setup.sh script that will install files and configure into the ~/opencv3-setup folder.



The cv3-install.menu.sh script and menu picks will:
---------------------------------------------------
* Validate that OPENCV_VER variable setting is correct
* Create cv3-log.txt If It Does Not Exist. The log will record system information, date/time and details of various steps including execution times
* Update/upgrade Raspbian for Raspberry Pi
* Install build dependencies
* Download opencv3 source zip files and unzip
* Auto Detect RPI3 and set NEON compile directive for cmake to enhance cv3 performance
* Run cmake to configure build
* Temporarily Increase Swap memory to 1024 MB During make
* Automatically Sets number of make cores. -j2 cores if 1 GB RAM detected, otherwise -j1 core directive is set.
* Run make to Compile opencv3 source code
* Run optional make clean to clear build directory to force full recompile.
* DELETE menu pick to optionally recover disk space by deleting the cv3-tmp folder containing opencv source and build files and folders.
